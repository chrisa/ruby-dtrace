Ruby-DTrace is Ruby bindings for Dtrace, which allows you to add
DTrace probes to your Ruby programs, and to write D-based programs
with Ruby.

== FEEDBACK

Fork the repository on Github: http://github.com/chrisa/ruby-dtrace

Rubyforge mailing list: http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/ruby-dtrace-users

== FEATURES

Consumer:

* Access to the D API
* Probe metadata
* Run D programs
* Access aggregates
* Consume output from D programs

Probes:

* Create USDT providers from Ruby, at runtime.
* No code-generation or gcc/linker dependency

== SYNOPSIS

Consumer: see Dtrace

    require 'Dtrace'

    t = Dtrace.new
    progtext = 'ruby$1:::function-entry{ @a[strjoin(strjoin(copyinstr(arg0),"."),copyinstr(arg1))] = count(); } END { printa(@a); }'
    prog = t.compile progtext
    prog.execute

    t.go

    [...]

    c = DtraceConsumer.new(t)
    c.consume_once do |rec|
      # handle records
    end

Probes: see Dtrace::Provider

    require 'dtrace/provider'

    Dtrace::Provider.create :rubyprog do |p|
      p.probe :foo, :string, :string
      p.probe :bar, :integer, :integer
    end

    Dtrace::Probe::Rubyprog.foo do |p|
      p.fire('fired!', 'again')
    end

    Dtrace::Probe::Rubyprog.bar do |p|
      p.fire(42, 27)
    end

== REQUIREMENTS

* For the consumer API, platform with DTrace support (OpenSolaris, Mac
  OS X 10.5 Leopard and 10.6 Snow Leopard tested, possibly also FreeBSD).

* For the probe API, a platform with DTrace support (as for the
  consumer API), with a 32 bit or 64 bit Ruby build - i386/x86_64,
  PowerPC (for OS X) and SPARC (for Solaris) are all supported.

* root, or some/all of the dtrace privileges on Solaris: dtrace_user,
  dtrace_proc and dtrace_kernel.

== INSTALL

 $ sudo gem install ruby-dtrace

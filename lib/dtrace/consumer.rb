# A Dtrace::Consumer provides access to the data produced by the running
# D program. Having compiled and executed a D program, you typically
# create a Dtrace::Consumer, and wait for data.
#
# You can either wait indefinitely for data, or consume all the data
# waiting and then stop: if your D program consists of only of
# aggregations, returned by printa() actions in the END block, this
# will be the best approach. If you have a mix of trace() and printf()
# actions elsewhere, you'll probably want to wait until interrupted,
# the D program itself exits, or your program decides it has collected
# enough data.
#
# The two approaches are implemented by the +consume+ and
# +consume_once+ methods.
#
# The +consume+ and +consume_once+ methods accept a block to which is
# yielded complete Dtrace::Data objects, one for each probe which fires.
#
# You must have already started tracing when you call +consume+ or
# +consume_once+, so the general structure will look like:
#
#   t = Dtrace.new
#   progtext = "..."
#   prog = t.compile progtext
#   prog.execute
#   t.go
#   c = Dtrace::Consumer.new(t)
#   c.consume_once do |d|
#     # handle Dtrace::Data objects
#     # ...
#     # get bored:
#     c.finish
#   end
